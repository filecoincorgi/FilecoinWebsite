            <p class="ts-20 fw-light line-height-15 mt-40 mr-150 pb-20">
                Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs) are the primary mechanism for proposing new features or processes
                for Filecoin. FIPs contain technical specifications for the proposed changes and act as the “source of
                truth” for the community. Network upgrades and application standards for Filecoin are discussed and
                developed through the FIP process.</p>
            <p class="ts-20 fw-light line-height-15 mt-40 mr-150 pb-20">
                Anyone within the Filecoin community has the ability to create an FIP. Guidelines for writing FIPs are
                included in <span class="text-seagreen">FIP- 1</span>. The FIP should provide a concise technical
                specification of the feature and its
                rationale. The FIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting
                dissenting opinions. Given the high technical bar for submitting a well-formed FIP, historically, most
                FIP authors have been application or protocol developers.</p>
            <h1 class="ts-35 fw-light pt-10 mr-150">Why do FIPs matter?</h1>
            <p class="ts-20 fw-light line-height-15 mt-40 mr-150 pb-20">
                FIPs play a central role in how changes happen and are documented on Filecoin. They are the way for
                people to propose, debate and adopt changes. There are three different types of FIPs:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-type-none">
                <li class="pb-20 ts-20 fw-light line-height-15"> <span class="text-seagreen pr-10">•</span> Technical
                    FIPs describe any change that
                    affects most or all Filecoin implementations, such as a change to the the network protocol, a change
                    in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or
                    addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Filecoin.

                    FIPs describe processes
                    surrounding Filecoin or propose a change to a process. Examples include procedures, guidelines,
                    changes to the decision-making process, changes to the FIP process, and changes to the tools or
                    environment used in Filecoin development.</li>
                <li class="pb-20 ts-20 fw-light line-height-15"><span class="text-seagreen pr-10">•</span>Recovery FIPs
                    that propose a state change
                    that that cannot be addressed using the standard protocol, They are only valid under a limited,
                    clearly-defined set of criteria (e.g., in the case of protocol bugs destroying network value). </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ts-20 fw-light line-height-15 mt-40 mr-150 pb-20">
                Along with providing a technical specification for changes, FIPs are the unit around which governance
                happens in Filecoin: anyone is free to propose one, and then various stakeholders in the community will
                debate to determine if it should be adopted as a standard or included in a network upgrade. Non-core
                FIPs
                don't have to be adopted by all applications, but core FIPs must be widely adopted (because all nodes
                must
                upgrade to stay part of the same network) -- therefore core FIPs require broader consensus within the
                community than non-core FIPs.

            <p class="ts-20 fw-light line-height-15 mt-40 mr-150 pb-20">
                The Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs) Github repository was created in March 2019 and launched in
                September 2020. The FIP process is based on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) process, which is
                itself based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process and the Python Enhancement Proposals
                (PEPs) process.

            <p class="ts-20 fw-light line-height-15 mt-40 mr-150 pb-20">
                FIP editors are tasked with reviewing FIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code
                style. The current FIP editors are:
